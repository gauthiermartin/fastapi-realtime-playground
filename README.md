# FastAPI-Realtime-Playground

## About the project

This project is a toy project to experiment on using FastAPI in a real time

The original idea for this project came from the following Medium article by Mohammad Hoseini Rad - [Scalable Real-Time Apps with Python and Redis: Exploring AsyncIO, FastAPI, and Pub/Sub](https://medium.com/itnext/scalable-real-time-apps-with-python-and-redis-exploring-asyncio-fastapi-and-pub-sub-79b56a9d2b94)
